# FrankTheLocalLLM

This repository contains a minimal frontâ€‘end built with Vue.js and Tailwind CSS plus a FastAPI backend and a .NET console application.

## Quick Start

Clone the repository and launch everything with a single command. The helper
script automatically installs dependencies, builds the .NET project and starts
both the backend and frontend:

```bash
./run_all.sh
```
Or clone and launch everything in one step:
```bash
 git clone <repository-url> FrankTheLocalLLM && cd FrankTheLocalLLM && ./run_all.sh
```

The script starts the .NET console app, installs Python dependencies, launches the FastAPI API and serves the Vue.js front-end.
Use `./run_logged.sh` if you want the same process to log output to `run.log`.

## Getting Started

1. Serve the Vue.js front-end from the `vue/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd vue
   python -m http.server 8080
   ```

   The page will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

2. In your browser open the served page. The client expects the FastAPI backend
   to be available at `http://localhost:8000/api`.
   When started the server tries to bind to port `8000` but if it is already
   taken the process automatically increments the port until a free one is
   found. Set the `PORT` environment variable to force a specific port or edit
   `backend/app/config.py`.

You can modify `vue/index.html` and `vue/app.js` to tweak the UI or add new
components.


## Backend API

A simple FastAPI backend is located in the `backend/` directory. The configuration uses environment variables via `pydantic` and enables CORS.

### Setup

1. Install Python 3.11 or newer.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python -m backend.app.main
   ```

The server exposes a sample endpoint at `/api/hello` returning a welcome message.

### Trivia Chain Demo

The backend now includes a simple [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com) setup
that uses a local LLM provided by [Ollama](https://ollama.ai). A small knowledge
base lives in `backend/data/trivia.md` and is loaded into a vector store on
startup. When Ollama is running locally, you can query this data via:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/trivia?q=What is the largest planet?"
```

Make sure to install the new Python dependencies and have an Ollama model (for
example `llama3`) available.


## Console Service

A .NET console application demonstrates SQLite data access using Dapper following a simple clean architecture layout. Projects reside in `src/`.

### Setup

1. Install the .NET SDK 8.0 or newer and verify the version:
   ```bash
   dotnet --version
   ```
   If the runtime loader complains about a different version (for example 9.0.1) install the matching SDK or update the `TargetFramework` in the project files.
2. Restore and build the solution (this also installs NuGet packages if needed):
   ```bash
   dotnet build src/ConsoleAppSolution.sln -c Release
   ```
3. Run the console app:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/ConsoleApp/ConsoleApp.csproj
   ```

If `dotnet restore` warns that vulnerability data cannot be downloaded you can disable the audit by placing a `nuget.config` file next to the solution with:

```xml
<configuration>
  <config>
    <add key="VulnerabilityMode" value="Off" />
  </config>
</configuration>
```

By default the app stores data in `app.db`, creating the database if it does not exist.
The infrastructure project also exposes a `UserRepository` with async CRUD
operations powered by Dapper. Migration scripts under
`src/Infrastructure/Migrations` set up tables for `users`, `entries`, `tasks`
and `llm_logs`. A simple `user_stats` view provides aggregate counts which the
repository surfaces via `GetStatsAsync`.

## Dev Container

A `.devcontainer` configuration is provided for offline development.
It installs Python 3.11, Node.js, the .NET 8 SDK, SQLite and Ollama.
The container mounts a Docker volume at `/root/.ollama` so models and
database files persist between sessions.

Launch the environment with the [devcontainer CLI](https://containers.dev/cli):

```bash
devcontainer up
```

## Running Everything Together

To build and launch all parts of the project at once run:

```bash
./run_all.sh
```

The script sequentially builds the .NET console app, installs Python dependencies, launches the FastAPI API and serves the Vue.js front-end on port 8080. Use `./run_logged.sh` to run the same process with output logged to `run.log`. The backend server stops automatically when you exit the HTTP server.
On Windows run the commands from `run_all.sh` one by one in PowerShell (first `cd vue`, then `python -m http.server 8080`) or execute the script in WSL. Running them in order ensures all dependencies are restored.

Background tasks that summarize entries can be started separately using

```bash
celery -A backend.app.tasks worker --beat
```



## Testing
Run `scripts/test_pipeline.sh` to lint frontend code, run vitest and pytest suites and apply SQL migrations in a container. If Docker is not available the migration step is skipped.
